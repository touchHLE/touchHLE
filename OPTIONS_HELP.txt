View options:
    --fullscreen
        Display the app in full screen. The default is to display in a window
        instead, except on Android which always uses full screen.

        The app's output will be scaled to fit your screen. This is independent
        of the internal resolution, so if the scale hack (see below) is not also
        in use, the result may be a bit blurry. An internal resolution larger
        than your screen's is possible, in which case the output is downscaled.

    --landscape-left
    --landscape-right
        Changes the orientation the virtual device will have at startup.
        The default is portrait.

        --landscape-left means rotate 90° counterclockwise from portrait.
        --landscape-right means rotate 90° clockwise from portrait.

        Usually apps that require landscape mode will tell touchHLE about this,
        and it will automatically rotate the window, but some apps neglect to
        do this. These options may be useful in that case.

    --scale-hack=...
        Set a scaling factor for the window. touchHLE will attempt to run the
        app with an increased internal resolution. This is a hack and there's
        no guarantee it will work correctly for all apps.

        The default is no scale hack, which is equivalent to a value of 1 (i.e.
        a scale of 1×).

        This is a natural number that is at least 1.

Game controller options:
    --deadzone=...
        Configures the size of the \"dead zone\" for analog stick inputs.

        The default value is 0.1, which means that 10% of the stick's range on
        the X and Y axes around the center position will be collapsed into a
        single point, so that movements in that range are ignored.

        This is a floating-point (decimal) number between 0 and 1.

    --x-tilt-range=...
    --y-tilt-range=...
        Set the simulated rotation range of the device on its X or Y axis.

        By default, an analog stick's axis is mapped to a rotation range of 60°
        (30° in either direction). If you wanted a range of 90° on the X axis,
        you could use --x-tilt-range=90.

        Note that the device's X axis is mapped to the analog stick's Y axis
        and vice-versa, because tilting the device to the left means rotating
        it on its Y axis, and so on.

        This is a floating-point (decimal) number of degrees, without a degree
        symbol. It may be negative.

    --x-tilt-offset=...
    --y-tilt-offset=...
        Offset the simulated angle of the device on its X or Y axis.

        By default, the device is simulated as being level with the ground when
        the stick is in the center/neutral position. This option is intended for
        games that use a different angle relative to the ground as their neutral
        position. For example, if a game expects you to hold the device in a
        landscape orientation, with a 45° angle to the ground, you might use
        --y-tilt-offset=45.

        Note that the device's X axis is mapped to the analog stick's Y axis
        and vice-versa, because tilting the device to the left means rotating
        it on its Y axis, and so on.

        This is a floating-point (decimal) number of degrees, without a degree
        symbol. It may be negative.

    --button-to-touch=...
        Maps a button on your game controller to a point on the simulated touch
        screen of the device. Pressing the button will behave like touching that
        part of the screen.

        This is three parts separated by commas: the name of a button (Xbox-like
        A, B, X or Y), the X co-ordinate and the Y co-ordinate. The co-ordinates
        are floating-point (decimal) numbers. 0,0 is the top-left corner. The
        bottom-right corner is 320,480 if the app is in portrait, and 480,320 if
        the app is in landscape.

        For example, --button-to-touch=A,470,310 will make the A button simulate
        tapping in the bottom-right corner of the screen, for a landscape game.

        Except where specified in touchHLE_default_options.txt, this is not used
        by default. There is however a virtual cursor that is controlled by the
        right analog stick (tap/hold by pressing the stick or right shoulder
        button).

Graphics driver options:
    --gles1=...
        Force touchHLE to use a particular OpenGL ES 1.1 implementation.
        This may be useful for troubleshooting graphics driver issues.

        --gles1=gles1_on_gl2 will use touchHLE's GLES1-on-GL2 layer.
        --gles1=gles1_native will use native OpenGL ES 1.1.

        When this option isn't in use, touchHLE will try each in order and use
        the first one that works.

Debugging options:
    --disable-direct-memory-access
        Force dynarmic to always access guest memory via the memory access
        callbacks, rather than using the fast direct access path (page tables).

    --gdb=...
        Starts touchHLE in debugging mode, listening for GDB remote serial
        protocol connections over TCP on the specified host and port.

        You can then connect to touchHLE with GDB and make use of its features
        to inspect memory and registers, set up software breakpoints, and
        continue or step execution.

        The host and port should be separated by a colon. The host can be a
        host name or an IP address. IPv6 addresses should be enclosed in square
        brackets, e.g. --gdb=[::1]:9001 for IPv6 loopback device port 9001.

Other options:
    --headless
        Run in headless mode. touchHLE will not create a window, so there will
        be no graphical output and no input. Only useful for command-line apps.

    --print-fps
        Logs the current framerate (FPS) to the console once per second.
