      "message": "This can\u0027t work; NSSet (and the Rust HashMap we\u0027re using to implement it) is unordered, so it will return a different touch if more are added later. Also, I guess there\u0027ll be weird touchesMoved/touchesEnd events that don\u0027t correspond to the single touch the view is aware of. I think the event handling code will have to reject additional touches if the view is not multi-touch aware. Exactly what should happen to those touches, I\u0027m not sure…",
