      "message": "First of all, you need to set +1 verified on your patch sets. Commonly, it means that you \"verified\" it - linter is passing, tests are passing, build is ok, etc.\n\nOnce you have +2 from reviewers, you will have \"Ready to submit\" status. Once clicked on \"Submit\" and if there is no merge conflicts with a trunk, Gerrit will rebase your patch set on the trunk and also sync it to GitHub.",
