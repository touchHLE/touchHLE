      "message": "Thanks.\n\nThe code seems to make sense at first glance but I didn\u0027t look too closely. I was scared this would break unusual uses of CallFromHost, but I think those don\u0027t call it for GuestFunctions, so it should be okayâ€¦\n\nI notice two problems:\n\n- What is GuestFunction::call() for, now? GuestFunction::call_without_pushing_stack_frame() has a reason to exist, but I think ::call() might only be used for running the module init functions and pthread_once routine. The pthread_once case can be changed to use CallFromHost (with an empty argument list and return value). Then maybe we can just get rid of GuestFunction::call() by inlining the relevant bit in the code that calls the module init functions.\n- The documentation of CallFromGuest and CallFromHost probably needs updating now? The documentation removed with GuestFunction::call() could go on CallFromHost instead, but it would need some adjustments.",
