# touchHLE: high-level emulator for iPhone OS apps

**touchHLE** is a high-level emulator for iPhone OS apps. It runs on modern desktop operating systems and Android, and is written in Rust.

touchHLE's high-level emulation (HLE) approach differs from low-level emulation (LLE) in that it does not directly simulate the iPhone/iPod touch hardware. Instead of running iPhone OS inside emulation, touchHLE _itself_ takes the place of iPhone OS and provides its own implementations of the system frameworks (Foundation, UIKit, OpenGL ES, OpenAL, etc). The only code the [emulated CPU](https://github.com/merryhime/dynarmic) executes is the app binary and [a handful of libraries](touchHLE_dylibs/).

The goal of this project is to run games from the early days of iOS:

* Currently: iPhone and iPod touch apps for iPhone OS 2.x and iPhone OS 3.0.
* Longer term: iPhone OS 3.1, iPad apps (iPhone OS 3.2), iOS 4.x, ‚Ä¶
* [Never](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/issues/181#issuecomment-1777098259): 64-bit iOS.

Support for apps that aren't games isn't a priority: it's more complex and less fun.

The [touchHLE app compatibility database](https://appdb.touchhle.org/) tracks which apps work in touchHLE. It is a crowdsourced effort to which anyone can contribute.

This project is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc in any way. iPhone, iOS, iPod, iPod touch and iPad are trademarks of Apple Inc in the United States and other countries.

Only use touchHLE to emulate software you have obtained legally.

## Platform support

* Officially supported: x64 Windows, x64 macOS and AArch64 Android.
  * These are the platforms with binary releases.
  * If you're an Apple Silicon Mac user, the x64 build reportedly works in Rosetta.
* Probably works, but you must build it yourself: AArch64 macOS, x64 Linux, AArch64 Linux.
* Never?: other architectures.

Input methods:

- For simulated touch input, there are four options:
  - Mouse/trackpad input (tap/hold/drag by pressing the left mouse button)
  - Virtual cursor using a game controller (move the cursor with the right analog stick , and tap/hold/drag by pressing the stick or the right shoulder button)
  - Mapping of game controller buttons (see the description of `--button-to-touch=` in `OPTIONS_HELP.txt`)
  - Real touch input, if you're on a device that has a touch screen
- For simulated accelerometer input, there are three options:
  - Tilt control simulation using the left analog stick of a game controller
  - Tilt control simulation using a mouse (hold down the right mouse button)
  - Real accelerometer input, if you are using a phone, tablet or some other device with a built-in accelerometer (TODO: support game controllers with accelerometers)

## Development status

This project has been in development since December 2022. This was originally [hikari\_no\_yume](https://hikari.noyu.me/)'s full-time passion project. Since its release in February 2023, a number of other volunteers have also [contributed in their free time](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/graphs/contributors), and this is no longer a single-person project. There's only been a handful of releases so far and no promises can be made about the future. Please be patient.

In general, the supported functionality is defined by the supported apps: most contributors are interested in getting a particular game working, and contribute support for whichever missing features are needed for that game. Consequently, the completeness varies a lot between APIs, e.g. UIKit is easily the most hacky and incomplete of the large frameworks that have been implemented, because most games don't use very much of its functionality, whereas the OpenGL ES and OpenAL implementations are probably complete enough to cover a large number of early apps, because games make heavy use of these.

# Usage

First obtain touchHLE, either a [binary release](https://github.com/touchHLE/touchHLE/releases) or by building it yourself (see the next section).

You'll then need an app that you can run. The [app compatibility database](https://appdb.touchhle.org/) is a good guide for which versions of which apps are known to work, but bear in mind that it may contain outdated or inaccurate information. Note that the app binary must be decrypted to be usable.

There's a few ways you can run an app in touchHLE.

## Special Android notes

Windows, Mac and Linux users can skip this section.

On Android, only the graphical user interface (app picker) is available. Therefore, you must put your ‚Äú.ipa‚Äù files or ‚Äú.app‚Äù bundles inside the ‚ÄútouchHLE\_apps‚Äù directory. Note that you can only do that once you have run touchHLE at least once.

File management can be tricky on Android due to [restrictions introduced by Google in newer Android versions](https://developer.android.com/about/versions/11/privacy/storage#scoped-storage). One of these methods may work:

* If you tap the ‚ÄúFile manager‚Äù button in touchHLE, this should open some sort of file manager. You might also be able to find touchHLE in your device's file manager app (often called ‚ÄúFiles‚Äù, or sometimes ‚ÄúDownloads‚Äù), alongside cloud storage services. There are some limitations on what kinds of operations are possible. The files in this location are stored on your device. Warning: on some devices, the ‚ÄúFile manager‚Äù button _will_ open a file manager, but it will crash when actually doing file operations (this is probably a bug in Android, we have not been able to debug it). If this happens to you, clear that file manager from your recent apps list and try to navigate to your device's file manager app directly instead, rather than via the touchHLE UI.
* If you have an older version of Android, you may be able to directly access touchHLE's files by browsing to `/sdcard/Android/data/org.touchhle.android/files/touchHLE_apps`. Note that the `/sdcard` directory is usually not on the SD card.
* You may be able to use ADB. If you're unfamiliar with ADB, try using <https://yume-chan.github.io/ya-webadb/> (in Google Chrome or another browser with WebUSB) with your device connected over USB. touchHLE's files can be found in ‚Äúsdcard‚Äù > ‚ÄúAndroid‚Äù > ‚Äúdata‚Äù > ‚Äúorg.touchhle.android‚Äù > ‚Äúfiles‚Äù > ‚ÄútouchHLE\_apps‚Äù.

## Graphical user interface

touchHLE has a built-in app picker. If you put your `.ipa` files and `.app` bundles in the `touchHLE_apps` directory, they will show up in the app picker when you run touchHLE.

To configure the options, you can edit the `touchHLE_options.txt` file. To get a list of options, look in the `OPTIONS_HELP.txt` file.

## Command-line user interface

**This section does not apply on Android.**

You can see the command-line usage by passing the `--help` flag.

If you're a Windows user and unfamiliar with the command line, these instructions may help you get started:

1. Move the `.ipa` file or `.app` bundle to the same folder as `touchHLE.exe`.
2. Hold the Shift key and right-click on the empty space in the folder window.
3. Click ‚ÄúOpen with PowerShell‚Äù.
4. Type `.\touchHLE.exe "YourAppNameHere.ipa"` (or `.app` as appropriate) and press Enter. If you want to specify options, add a space after the app name (outside the quotes) and then type the options, separated by spaces.

## Other stuff

Any data saved by the app (e.g. **saved games**) are stored in the `touchHLE_sandbox` folder.

If the emulator crashes almost immediately while running a **known-working** version of a game, please check whether you have any overlays turned on like the Steam overlay, Discord overlay, RivaTuner Statistics Server, etc. Sadly, as useful as these tools are, they work by injecting themselves into other apps or games and don't always clean up after themselves, so they can break touchHLE‚Ä¶ it's not our fault. üò¢ Currently only RivaTuner Statistics Server is known to be a problem. If you find another overlay that doesn't work, please tell us about it.
