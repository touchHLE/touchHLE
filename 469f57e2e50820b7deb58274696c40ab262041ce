If you\u0027re taking host object of class itself with get_host_object() (which may fail silently), why are you just borrowing for superclass here?\n\nFYI this will fail if the superclass if unimplemented. You\u0027ll need to handle that somehow.\nEither by checking for FakeClass/UnimplementedClass before downcasting and/or logging a fail to downcast.\n\nMaybe use get_host_object() for superclass as well and add logs for the downcast failures.",
