      "message": "FWIW, the same would be true even if we didn\u0027t use downloaded llvm/clang, since the tests work fine on newest clang. I\u0027ll change it so that it uses the clang/linker from an environment variable or the directory,\n\nUnfortunately, I don\u0027t think it\u0027s possible (or at least, it\u0027s really difficult) to build the linker port on windows,even with cygwin. I might(?) have something to solve this in the future but for now there\u0027s not much that can be done.",
