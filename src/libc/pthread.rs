//! POSIX Threads implementation.
//!
//! The pthread API often wants functions to check some precondition and return
//! an error if it isn't met. For convenience and for the sake of debugging this
//! implementation, we'll usually assert on these conditions instead, assuming
//! that the app is well-written and that it won't rely on these soft failures.
//! Cases like this will be marked with a comment saying what error should have
//! been returned, e.g. `assert!(...); // should be EINVAL`.
